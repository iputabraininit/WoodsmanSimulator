## Woodsman Mock RPG Simulator (Godot)

### Introduction
A very text-driven RPG simulator written using the Godot game engine.
Working with Godot 4.2.1

Creates a websocket server exposed on port `50102`, for an agent to connect to.

Agent code here: [Woodsman Agent](https://github.com/iputabraininit/KettleAgent.git).

_Note:_ This code is an attempt to demonstrate the concept of a simple command driven RPG and be simple to understand, it's not supposed to be production quality code.

### Setup
Download Godot, and open the project.

### Running
Run the main `root_scene.tscn`.
